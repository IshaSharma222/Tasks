contains the KRSSG tasks 

##**Task 1** 

This task has been programmed using the FSM Architecture.

To run the fsm.cpp file type the following command

`g++ fsm.cpp`

`./a.out`

##**Task 2**

The RRT*.py program uses pygame which is a cross-platform module of Python. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. This pygame has been used to create a window

To install pygame for python2, type the following commands on the terminal:

`sudo apt-get install python-pygame`

and then start the python2 interpreter

`python2`

and then try to import pygame as

`import pygame`

To run the turtle.py file first use:

`source devel/setup.bash`

Then make the file executable using 

`chmod u+x ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlesim_cleaner/src/turtle.py`

finally:

`rosrun turtlesim_cleaner turtle.py`

In the turtle.py program we need to input the points which are printed by running RRT*.py file to make the turtle move along the desired path.
